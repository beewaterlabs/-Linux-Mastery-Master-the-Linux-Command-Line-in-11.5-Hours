# Downloading Source Code

# /etc/apt/sources.list:
# Is a configuration file
# that your package manager uses to determine which repositories
# and which package files it downloads.
# In other words, which sources it downloads:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list <--- Worked in "artful" release

# In that OS release, you would uncomment the "deb-src" to activate the ability to download source code.
# The you would run ---> sudo apt-get update to install all the source packages into our cache.

# Note, in Ubuntu "24.04.2 LTS (Noble Numbat)"

# Ubuntu sources have moved to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources
# The "deb-src" text does not exist in this OS release.

# Before we can download source code,
# we need to install one more package:

sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev
