# Downloading Source Code

# /etc/apt/sources.list:
# Is a configuration file
# that your package manager uses to determine which repositories
# and which package files it downloads.
# In other words, which sources it downloads:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list <--- Worked in "artful" release

# Note, in Ubuntu "24.04.2 LTS (Noble Numbat)"

# Ubuntu sources have moved to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources
