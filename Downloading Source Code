# Downloading Source Code

# /etc/apt/sources.list:
# Is a configuration file
# that your package manager uses to determine which repositories
# and which package files it downloads.
# In other words, which sources it downloads:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list <--- Worked in "artful" release

# In that OS release, you would uncomment the "deb-src" to activate the ability to download source code.
# The you would run ---> sudo apt-get update to install all the source packages into our cache.

# Note, in Ubuntu "24.04.2 LTS (Noble Numbat)"

# Ubuntu sources have moved to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources
# The "deb-src" text does not exist in this OS release.

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources

# Add deb-src to each entry, here is the file after edits:

# Before we can download source code,
# we need to install one more package:

sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev

# Installing pre-compiled binary versions of software packages, uses the following syntax:
# sudo apt-get install <software-package-name>
# sudo apt-get install x11-apps

# To download the source code, use the following syntax:
# sudo apt-get source <software-package-name>

sudo apt-get source x11-apps

# Now you can see the source code tarball:

tron@ubuntu-dev:~/Desktop$ sudo apt-get source x11-apps
