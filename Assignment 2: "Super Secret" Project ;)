# Assignment 2: "Super Secret" Project ;)

# Task 1: This took 10 minutes (including VSCode edits). 

# Created the directory "super_secret_stuff":
mkdir super_secret_stuff

# Changed to the super_secret_stuff directory:
cd super_secret_stuff

# Created the file "top_secret.txt":
nano top_secret.txt

# Updated the database:
sudo updatedb

# Ran the locate command and redirected the file path output to a file called "secret_place.txt" in the home directory: 
locate top_secret.txt > /home/adminuser/secret_place.txt

# Read the contents of "secret_place.txt":
cat secret_place.txt 

# Output of "secret_place.txt":
/home/adminuser/Desktop/super_secret_stuff/top_secret.txt

# Task 2, Part A: This took 20 minutes.

# Use the find command to search your entire file tree; starting from the / directory, for all files that are over 1 MebiByte in size. 
# Use the maxdepth option to limit the find commandâ€™s search to only go 4 levels deep. The search should only show files.
# Use the -exec option of the find command to run the ls -lh command on each of those results.

sudo find / -type f -size +1M -maxdepth 4 -exec ls -lh {} \;

# Task 2, Part B: This took 25 minutes.

# Sort the output from Part A using the sort command.
# You should sort the data so that the largest file sizes are at the top of the list and the smallest file sizes are at the bottom.

 sudo find / -maxdepth 4 -type f -size +1M -exec ls -lh {} \; | sort -k 5nr > /home/adminuser/filesizes.txt
