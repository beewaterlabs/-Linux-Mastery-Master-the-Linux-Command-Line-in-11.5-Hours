# cat the cups-browsed.conf file:          Printer configuration file.

cat /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf

# less                                     Saves you from having a load of text filling up your screen.

less /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf           View file starting at the top with a scroll option.

cat /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf | less     Same result as above.
find | less                                If you | (pipe) find into less, you can now scroll!

# Filters:
# cat: Displays the text of a file line by line.
# head: Displays the first n lines of specified text files.
# tail: Returns lines from bottom to top, similar to head but in reverse order.
# sort: Sorts lines alphabetically by default, with various options to modify sorting.
# uniq: Removes duplicate lines.

# head                                     The head command will allow you to see a little piece of the file, starting at the top, or the head, of the file.
                                           Default = first 10 lines of the file.

# Use the -n option to indicate <x> lines.

# NotifLeaseDuration defines how long the D-BUS subscription created by cups-browsed
# in cupsd will last before cupsd cancels it. The default value is 1 day
# in seconds - 86400. The subscription renewal is set to happen after half of
# NotifLeaseDuration passed. The D-BUS notifications are used for watching over queues
# and doing specific actions when a D-BUS notification comes.

# NotifLeaseDuration 86400

# FrequentNetifUpdate turns on/off the network interface update routines
# which happen for each found entry, which can slow up cups-browsed significantly
# if we are on a network with many shared printers or if we use BrowsePoll to a server
# with many queues. Network interface updates after receiving D-BUS notification
# from NetworkManager won't be turned off with the directive. The default value
# is 'Yes'.
