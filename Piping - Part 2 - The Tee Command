# Data strem 0        Standard input.
# Data strem 1        Standard output.
# Data strem 2        Standard error.

# Ubuntu example:

adminuser@ubuntu:~$ date | tee fulldate.txt | cut --delimiter " " --fields 1

# Once you do re-direction >, you can no longer pipe. Unless your using the tee command (snapshot) of data while continuing your piping.
# The following cmd will run the date command and then take a snapshot of the full output and save it in the "fulldate.txt" file, then will process the cut command and re-direct the results to a file called "today.txt" 
# Ubuntu example:

adminuser@ubuntu:~$ date | tee fulldate.txt | cut --delimiter " " --fields 1 > today.txt
adminuser@ubuntu:~$ cat fulldate.txt
Thu Jan 16 02:23:10 AM UTC 2025
adminuser@ubuntu:~$ cat today.txt 
Thu
