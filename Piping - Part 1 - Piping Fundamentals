Thu Jan 16 01:00:40 AM UTC 2025                   Each column is seperated by spaces. 

cut < date.txt --delimiter " " --fields 1         Cut command will use the --delimiter option (Tells what devides the columns).
                                                  " " = space is what delimits this file.
                                                  --fields 1 (The first field).

adminuser@ubuntu:~$ cut < date.txt --delimiter " " --fields 1
Thu

date | cut --delimiter " " --fields 1            Pipe the data from the date command standard output into the cut command's standard input.

# This command pipes the data from the date command's standard output into the cut command's standard input and then adds the ouput to a file called today.txt:

adminuser@ubuntu:~$ date | cut --delimiter " " --fields 1 > today.txt
adminuser@ubuntu:~$ cat today.txt 
Thu

# You can send the data from the standard output of the cut command to another command by using a | (pipe):

date | cut --delimiter " " --fields 1 | command -options args

# Redirections > are processed before the pipes | in linux.
