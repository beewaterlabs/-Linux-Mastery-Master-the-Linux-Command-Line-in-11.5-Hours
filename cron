# cron        A time-based job scheduler used for automating and scheduling repetitive tasks. ☞ Named ater the Greek God of Time ☞ Cronos

# Each user has a crontab file:
# Each crontab file consists of commands, one per line, that execute automatically at the time specified by the first five fields at the beginning of each command line.
# To edit your crontab file:

crontab -e

# You will see a handy guide:

# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 

# The first 5 columns are for schedualing. The 6th column is reserved for entering the command or script to be run.
# Column 1: Minute [0-59], * = Any minute.
# Column 2: Hours [0-23], 11 = 11am, 13 = 1pm, 24 = midnight, -12 to translate to a 12 hour clock time.
# Column 3: 
# Column 4: 
# Column 5:
