# cron        A time-based job scheduler used for automating and scheduling repetitive tasks. ☞ Named ater the Greek God of Time ☞ Cronos

# Each user has a crontab file:
# Each crontab file consists of commands, one per line, that execute automatically at the time specified by the first five fields at the beginning of each command line.
# To edit your crontab file:

crontab -e

# You will see a handy guide:

# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 

# The first 5 columns are for schedualing. The 6th column is reserved for entering the command or script to be run.
# You can have multiple spaces between the columns for easier readability.
# * = Any

# Column 1: m    | Minute [0-59]
# Column 2: h    | Hours [0-23], 11 = 11am, 13 = 1pm, 24 = midnight, -12 to translate to a 12 hour clock time.
# Column 3: dom  | Day of the month [1-31]
# Column 4: mon  | Month [1-12] or [JAN, FEB, etc]
# Column 5: dow  | Day of week [0-6] 0 = sunday, 6 = saturday or [MON, TUE, etc]

# This cron job runs the command echo "Hello World" and appends the output to ~/Desktop/hello.txt every minute of every hour of every day:

# m     h       dom     mon     dow     command

  *     *       *       *       *       echo "Hello World" >> ~/Desktop/hello.txt

# If I cat the "hello.txt" file, you will see how many minutes it took me to edit lines 42~48 after saving the crontab file:

tron@ubuntu-dev:~$ cat Desktop/hello.txt | wc -l
3

# Witout piping to the word count command:

tron@ubuntu-dev:~$ cat Desktop/hello.txt 
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
