How long it Took You to Complete The Assignment in Minutes (estimate)

2h:
I wasted time with a test run on a Fedora 36 VM, using "Man" as file1.txt & "Bat" as file2.txt. Should have just used the project instructions on my Ubuntu VM, was trying to be comical (pun intended)...

The sort -r option did not work, however the -d option for alphabet logic sorting worked...

Once I ran through the instructions and used excel to proof list counts and order, it did not take long :)
