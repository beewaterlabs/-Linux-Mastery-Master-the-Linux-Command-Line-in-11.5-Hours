# Permission-Decoder

# Read = (r) The read permission allows users to view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory.
# Write = (w) The write permission allows users to modify a file's contents or add, remove, or rename files within a directory.
# Execute = (x) The execute permission allows users to execute a file or traverse (i.e., enter) a directory. For files, execute permission is required to run the file as a program or script. For directories, execute permission is required to access the contents of the directory.
# - = file
# d = directory

# A script that will output a given file(s) permissions:

-------SOF-------

#!/bin/bash

# Check if a file is provided as an argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then

    exit 1

if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then

# Get the file permissions using ls -l
ls -l "$file"

# Alternatively, get detailed permissions using stat
stat -c "%A %n" "$file"
