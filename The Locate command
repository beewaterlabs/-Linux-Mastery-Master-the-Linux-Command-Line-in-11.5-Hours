# The Locate command:		 Can be ran from any directory.

# Install Locate on Ubuntu:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install locate
sudo updatedb                    After installation, you need to populate the locate database for the first time. Then updating therafter.

# Locate now works:

locate *.conf                    Search everywhere for .conf files.

tron@ubuntu-dev:~/destination$ locate -i --limit 3 *.conf		Case insensitivity [-i] [--limit] results to 3.
/etc/adduser.conf
/etc/apg.conf
/etc/brltty.conf

locate -S                        Database data.

tron@ubuntu-dev:~/destination$ locate -S
Database /var/cache/locate/locatedb is in the GNU LOCATE02 format.

# Locate command - Part 2:

# Demonstration of the database not finding a file because it was not synced:

touch findthis.txt		 Create a file called findthis.txt

adminuser@ubuntu:~locate findthis.txt
# Output = Not found.
# After syncing the database ---> sudo updatedb

adminuser@ubuntu:~$ locate findthis.txt 
/home/adminuser/findthis.txt

# To protect you from errors, use the options below:

locate --existing		  Only entries referring to files existing at the time the locate command is run are printed.
locate --follow			  When used with the locate command, instructs the command to follow trailing symbolic links when checking whether files exist, especially when the --existing option is specified. This means that broken symbolic links will be omitted from the output, as the command will only report on existing files.	

locate -e *.conf		  Check the database for all files that end with .conf and check that they exist.
locate --existing *.conf	  Long form option.

# Sometimes there are shortcuts and links on your system called symbolic links
# that might be broken if files get moved around.
# To check whether these shortcuts and links are still valid
# before the locate command reports them back,
# you can use the capital L or the follow option like this:

locate --follow *.conf

# Maximun assurance:

locate --existing --follow *.conf
