# Uninstalling Software:

# syntax:

sudo apt-get remove <package-name>

# This will leave configuration files on the system.
# Can be helpfull if you plan to re-install the package in the future and want all the setting to be the same.

# To remove a package and its configuration files:

sudo apt-get purge x11-apps

# In order to remove packages that were installed as dependencies
# but are no longer required for any other package on the system:

sudo apt-get autoremove

# Whenever you download an installer package
# a copy of the package is saved locally on your computer.
# Now this package is then unpacked and installed on your system.

# When you install a package, it downloads itself as a compressed archive
# then unpacks itself and installs itself on your system.

# Now because of that two-step process
# not only is a package installed on your system
# but a compressed version of it is also saved.
# These compressed archive files are not needed after installation.

# Save yourself massive amounts of space just by deleting these archives.
# These archives are stored at:

/var/cache/apt/archives
