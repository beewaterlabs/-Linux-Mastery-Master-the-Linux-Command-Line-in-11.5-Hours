# Hungry for Data Project

### Task 1:
In this task you are asked to create a bash script called hungry.sh in your home directory.
hungry.sh should do two things:
Firstly, it should output the text I am hungry. Feed me data. to a file in your home directory
called demands.txt
Secondly, hungry.sh should also output the date and time that the demand was made to a file
in your home directory called demands.log
Do ensure that each output is appended to the previous one.
Hint: Ensure that the bash script starts with the required #!/bin/bash text
###

# Script:

tron@ubuntu-dev:~$ cat hungry.sh 
#!/bin/bash

echo "I am hungry. Feed me data." >> ~/demands.txt
date >> ~/demands.log

# Task 2:
Once you have created hungry.sh , you are tasked to edit your crontab and add a new row
so that hungry.sh runs every minute. Your computer loves data, after all ;)

# crontab -e:

# m  h  dom  mon  dow  command
  *  *  *    *    *    bash ~/hungry.sh

# Proof cron job ran the script successfully:

tron@ubuntu-dev:~$ cat demands.txt; cat demands.log 
I am hungry. Feed me data.
I am hungry. Feed me data.
