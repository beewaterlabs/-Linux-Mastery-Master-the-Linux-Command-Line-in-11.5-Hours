# Ubuntu - Course Configuration
# I could not find an Desktop version of Ubuntu that was build for the Macintosh OS.
# I was able to find "ubuntu-24.04.1-live-server-arm64.iso".
# Once installed I ran the following command to upgrade to the Desktop version with a gnome interface:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop

# Now Ubuntu desktop is alive!

# There are issues with missing drivers that will cause your mouse to be captured within the VM / not copy and paste from the host OS.
# You can resolve this by installing the supported VBox kernel module mouse driver.
# This process creates the modules on the system where they will be used:

# From the Oracle VirtualBox Manager:

#   You can get the "VBoxGuestAdditions.iso" here ---> /Applications/VirtualBox.app/(Right click)Contents/MacOS/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso
#   Attach the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso (Settings/Storage/Devices/Then attach .iso media)

# You may need to install some software packages from the distribution which are needed for the build process. Required packages may include the following:

# GNU compiler (GCC)
# GNU Make (make)
# Kernel header files (Should have the correct packages installed by default)

# From the Ubuntu VM:

    apt-get update
    apt-get install gcc make perl
    cd /media/adminuser/VBox_GAs_7.1.4/
    sudo -i
    sh VBoxLinuxAdditions-arm64.run
    reboot

# Now you can copy and paste between your host OS and the Oracle Ubuntu VM without being notified about "mouse capture", just like the software tool Synergy :)
