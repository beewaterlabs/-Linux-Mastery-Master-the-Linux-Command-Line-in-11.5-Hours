# Ubuntu - Course Configuration
# I could not find an Desktop version of Ubuntu that was build for the Macintosh OS.
# I was able to find "ubuntu-24.04.1-live-server-arm64.iso".
# Once installed I ran the following command to upgrade to the Desktop version with a gnome interface:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop

# Now Ubuntu desktop is alive!

# CTRL + l                       Clear the screen.
# CTRL + d                       Close terminal.
# history -c; history -w         Clears history and writes changes to make them permanent.
